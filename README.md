# Bed System Experimental Control Software

This repository contains stable code used in our laboratory, intended for use
by lab members to control the bed-based imaging system. This software,
as of Oct 13, 2023, is intended to:

- Control the rotary stage
- Control the vector network analyzer (VNA)

This software does *not* control the vertical lift-stage.

This centralized repository allows individual lab members to build on a common
codebase, ensuring individuals can integrate novel work while minimizing
reproduction of solutions previously prepared by other lab members.  

## Getting Started

Before utilizing this repository, the following are either recommended or
required on your local computer:

- Python (required)
- Git (required)
- PyCharm (strongly recommended)

The rest of this section describes the installation procedures for these
components and assumes you are using Windows 10 as your operating system. If
you choose to use an alternative OS (e.g., Mac or Linux), you can follow 
the instructions provided at the links provided in each section. 

### Installing Python

To minimize technical issues, it is strongly recommended that all users install
an Anaconda Python distribution, accessible
[here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section). This
repository was designed for use with Python 3, and Python >= 3.7.

To install the Anaconda distribution,

1. Go to the
[Anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).
2. Download the 64-bit graphical installer for Python >= 3.7, available
[here directly](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86_64.exe).
